On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years, their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers Assemble!\"\\n\\n[BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.]\\n\\nCUT TO: EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE \\xad NIGHT\\n\\n[ Kneeling behind a THRONE, a clothed, armored figure known as THE OTHER. ]\\n\\nTHE OTHER: The tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power,... [he holds out the scepter]\\n\\nLoki: [Coming out from the shadows, taking the staff]\\n\\nTHE OTHER: But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow.\\n\\n[thousands of Chitauri are awaiting orders]\\n\\nTHE OTHER: The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\n[Cut to a SHIELD facility at night. They are evacuating by helicopter and vehicle, and one helicopter lands, dropping off Maria Hill and Nick Fury while Agent Phil Coulson is awaiting them.]\\n\\nNICK FURY: How bad is it?\\n\\nAGENT PHIL COULSON: That\\'s the problem sir. We don\\'t know.\\n\\n[They enter the facility, passing fleeing technicians, taking only the essentials]\\n\\nCOULSON: Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.\\n\\nFURY: NASA didn\\'t authorise Selvig to test phase.\\n\\nCOULSON: He wasn\\'t testing it, he wasn\\'t even in the room. Spontaneous advancement.\\n\\nAGENT MARIA HILL: It just turned itself on?\\n\\nFURY: What are the energy levels\\n\\nCOULSON: Climbing. When Selvig couldn\\'t shut it down, we ordered evac.\\n\\nFURY: How long to get everyone out?\\n\\nCOULSON: Campus should be clear in the next half hour.\\n\\nFURY: Do better. \\n\\n[They continue walking down deeper into the facility]\\n\\nHILL: Sir, evacuation may be futile.\\n\\nFURY: We should tell them to go back to sleep?\\n\\nHILL: If we can\\'t control the Tesseract\\'s energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.\\n\\nFURY: I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.\\n\\nHILL: Sir, is that really a priority right now?\\n\\nFURY: Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every peice of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.\\n\\nHILL: Yes sir. [To agents nearby.] With me.\\n\\n[Nick fury and Agent Phil Coulson enter the radiation facility housing the Tesseract, the area cluttered with machines and people leaving.]\\n\\nFURY: Talk to me doctor.\\n\\n[Dr. Erik Selvig appears from behind a CMS machine, concerned. The Tesseract is glowing unusually birghter and a flare of blue shoots out from it, hitting things at random.]\\n\\nDr. ERIK SELVIG: Director.\\n\\nFURY: Is there anything we know for certain?\\n\\nSELVIG: The Tesseract is misbehaving.\\n\\nFURY: Is that supposed to be funny?\\n\\nSELVIG: No, it\\'s not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she\\'s... misbehaving.\\n\\nFURY: How soon until you pull the plug?\\n\\nSELVIG:  She\\'s an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...\\n\\nFURY: We\\'ve prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space.\\n\\nSELVIG: We don\\'t have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she\\'s throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.\\n\\nFURY: That can be harmful. Where\\'s Barton?\\n\\nSELVIG: The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual\\n\\n[We cut to Clint Barton, dressed in black tactical gear, up on the railings watching them below. Fury calls Barton on his earpiece.]\\n\\nFURY: Agent Barton, report.\\n\\n[Barton rappels down from the catwalk, and walks up to Fury. They both walk around the bottom of the facility in a discreet manner.]\\n\\nFURY: I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.\\n\\nCLINT BARTON: Well, I see better from a distance.\\n\\nFURY:  Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?\\n\\nNASA SCIENCETIST: [To Dr. Erik Selvig] Doctor, it\\'s spiking again.\\n\\nCLINT: No one\\'s come or gone. It\\'s oven is clean. No contancts, no I.M.\\'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn\\'t at this end.\\n\\nFURY: At this end?\\n\\nCLINT: Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.\\n\\n[Dr. Erik Selvig types on his keyboard and the monitor flashes. Suddenly, the Tesseract thunders and shakes the entire facility. Both Agent Coulson nearby, and Maria Hill topside, feel the tremors. The cube glows brighter and emits a ring of light, and builds like a beam, similar to the Bifrost bridge. The power hits the edge of the platform, and begins to form a vortex, which becomes a portal. Space appears through the portal, and a gust of blue energy knocks people back. The cloud shoots to the ceiling, and the portal on the platform opens up as Loki steps through. The portal vanishes, and Loki grins at everyone, holding his spear. He frowns as he sees them looking at him.]\\n\\nFURY: Sir please put down the spear.\\n\\n[Loki responds with firing a blast of blue energy from his spear, while Barton narrowly tackles Fury out of the way. Everyone shoots at Loki, but the bullets deflect off of him. Loki immediately takes down everyone shooting at him easily, with knives and energy blasts from his sceptre. He pauses, grinning, and looks to who will attack him next. Barton attempts to attack him, but Loki grabs his wrist, disarming him.]\\n\\nLOKI: You have heart.\\n\\n[Loki places the tip of the spear against Barton\\'s chest. Barton\\'s eye glow black, and he stops resisting. Loki begins controlling other agents around the room. Fury sneak up, grabs the Tesseract, and places it in a briefcase, trying to sneak out.]\\n\\nLOKI: Please don\\'t. I still need that.\\n\\nFURY: [ turning to face Loki ] This doesn\\'t have to get any messier.\\n\\nLOKI: Of course it does. I\\'ve come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.\\n\\nSELVIG: Loki? Brother of Thor?\\n\\nFURY: We have no quarrel with your people.\\n\\nLOKI: An ant had no quarrel with a boot.\\n\\nFURY: You planning to step on us?\\n\\nLOKI: I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.\\n\\nFURY: Free from what?\\n\\nLOKI: Freedom. Freedom is life\\'s great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart...[Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who\\'s standing behind him and places his spear against Selvig\\'s heart. Selvig\\'s eyes glow black.]\\n\\nLOKI: You will know peace.\\n\\nFURY: Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing.\\n\\n[From the vacuum chamber ceiling, the Tesseract\\'s energy cloud rapidly builds into what may be an implosion.]\\n\\nCLINT: Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us. \\n\\nFURY: Like the Pharaohs of Odin.\\n\\nSELVIG: He\\'s right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.\\n\\nLOKI: Well then. \\n\\n[Loki looks to Barton, who without hesitation shoots Fury, who falls to the ground. Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig, and the other controlled SHIELD personnel.]\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\n[The controlled SHEILD personnel are gathering weapons and getting ready to leave the facility. Agent Hill watches in confusion.]\\n\\nCLINT: [Pointing to Loki and his team] Need these vehicles.\\n\\nHILL: Who\\'s that?\\n\\nCLINT: He didn\\'t tell me.\\n\\n[Agent hill eyes them suspiciously as they get into a truck and begin to drive away.]\\n\\nFURY: [grabbing a walkie talkie] Hill, do you copy?\\n\\n[Loki and his crew look back at Agent Hill.]\\n\\n[Back at the lab, Fury is sitting up, pulling the bullet out, and breathing hard.]\\n\\nFURY: Barton is...\\n\\n[Maria turns around and shoots Barton, who is already shooting at her, and they drive away while she takes cover, still firing at them.]\\n\\nFURY: [Running out of the lab, holding his side.] He\\'s got the Tesseract! Track it down!\\n\\n[The energy discharge from the Tesseract is building up on the ceiling, rumbling and growing recklessly, destroying structures and cracking the walls.]\\n\\n[Maria Hill jumps into a Jeep and takes chase on Loki and crew. Several other trucks begin to attack Loki\\'s truck as well, and Loki releases a blast of energy, obliterating SHEILD trucks and causing a blockage in the tunnel. Agent Hill is forced to keep distance on her pursuit.]\\n\\n[Down below, Fury is racing against the clock as pipes burst around him. The walls are cracking, and the facility is suffering an internal earthquake.]\\n\\n[Agent Coulson is grabbing cases, and trips down the stairs while the ground shudders. Others with him drop cases full of information and equipment.]\\n\\nCOULSON: No! Leave it! [They all leave the cases behind and leave the lab running.]\\n\\n[Barton and Agent Hill are caught in a truck race, where she pulls in front of him to try and block him. He responds with firing at her at close range, which causes Agent Hill to shoot out her own windshield to try and hit him.]\\n\\n[Agent Coulson and his group take a Jeep and evacuate as well.]\\n\\nCOULSON: [on a walkie talkie] You\\'re clear, sir! You need to go!\\n\\n[Fury runs across the tarmac to a helicopter. The ground gives way seconds after the helicopter leaves the ground, falling into a sinkhole.]\\n\\n[Still racing down the tunnel, Agent Hill and Barton are locked in combat. A blast wave from the Tesseract causes the tunnel to collapse partially. One of Loki\\'s trucks makes it out, but Maria\\'s truck is stuck.]\\n\\n[The Tesseract\\'s energy cloud now shrinks into a small ball of white light, hovering in the air. In a flash of blue light, the facility is consumed along with its surroundings. Fury watches from below as a rapid build up into an implosion.]\\n\\n[Several miles away, Agent Coulson\\'s van jolts from the blastwave on the horizon behind them.]\\n\\n[The entire facility implodes with terrifying magnitude, and the implosion rocks the ground.]\\n\\n[Maria Hill is stuckher jeep behind as the full force of the blast tears down on the tunnel, covering herself by being inside of the jeep, light from the night spilling in close by.]\\n\\n[Barton\\'s truck drives away, but Fury\\'s helicopter hovers over it, and Fury opens fire with his pistol. Loki, in a fit of rage, fires an energy blast at the helicopter. The helicopter is skimmed my the blast, but catches fire. He jumps out of the flaming helicopter seconds before it hits the ground and shreds itself into debris. Fury stands back up, dazed, and shoots at Loki, but they\\'re too far away.]\\n\\nCOULSON: [over a walkie talkie] Director? Director Fury, do you copy?\\n\\nFURY: The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?\\n\\nHILL: [climbing out of the wreckage of her jeep] A lot of men still under, don\\'t know how many survivors.\\n\\n[From the ground, Fury surveys the wreckage.]\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\nFURY: Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.\\n\\nHILL: [using a walkie talkie] Roger that.\\n\\nFURY: Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war.\\n\\nCOULSON: What do we do?\\n\\n[Nick Fury looks up, a thought on his mind.]\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\nTHE AVENGERS\\n[The scene is is Russia. There is a building, a warehouse, next to some unfinished railroad tracks under construction. The building is only occupied by Georgi Luchkov, a Russian general, and two thugs, with a prisoner amongst them, tied to a chair. The taller thug is in the middle of hitting the spy, a red headed Russian woman in a black tank top. They have a conversation in Russian.]\\n\\nGENERAL LUCHKOV: [in Russian] This is not how I wanted the evening to go.\\n\\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better.\\n\\nLUCHKOV: I\\'d like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items.\\n\\n[The taller thug pushes her chair back, tilting it over the edge of a few story drop, and Natasha hides her fear.]\\n\\nNATASHA: I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business.\\n\\nLUCHKOV: Solohob? Your reputation is quite a progression. The famous Black Widow. Nothing but a pretty face.\\n\\nNATASHA: You really think I\\'m pretty?\\n\\n[Luchkov walks over to a table filled with tools of torture and interrogation, picking up a pair of pliers. The tall thug next to her forces her jaw open.]\\n\\nLUCHKOV: We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks. Tell him, well... [In english] You may have to write it down.\\n\\n[A phone rings, and the weasely thug looks to his phone in confusion. He picks it up.]\\n\\nWEASELY THUG: Ya? [He looks to Luchkov.] It\\'s for you. \\n\\n[Luchkov takes the phone, annoyed and angry.]\\n\\nLUCHKOV: Who the hell is...\\n\\nCOULSON: You\\'re at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.\\n\\n[Luchkov places the cell phone against Natasha\\'s ear seeing how she\\'s tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back.]\\n\\nCOULSON: We need you to come in.\\n\\nNATASHA: Are you kidding? I\\'m working!\\n\\nCOULSON: This takes precedence.\\n\\nNATASHA: I\\'m in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.\\n\\nLUCHKOV: [Confused] I don\\'t give everything. \\n\\nNATASHA: [Frowning at Luchkov] Look, you can\\'t pull me out of this right now.\\n\\nCOULSON: Natasha. Barton\\'s been compromised.\\n\\nNATASHA: [After a beat] Let me put you on hold.\\n\\n[Natasha nods to Luchkov. When he grabs the phone, she hits him with her leg and headbuts him. She stands, still tied to the chair, and kickboxes the tall thug in the face. She rolls over to the weasely thug, trips him, and stomps on his foot when he tries to pin her, then she knocks him out with a headbut. Coulson waits calmly, listening to her take three men down with her arms literally tied behind her back. She flips, breaking the chair on weasely thugs\\' ribcage, and looks to the tall thug, standing up. She kicks him too, chocking him out cold. She then wraps Luchkov\\'s legs with a chain and pushes him down the hole he was threatening to drop her down. He hangs there, in pain, and she grabs her shoes and the phone.]\\n\\nNATASHA: Where\\'s Barton now?\\n\\nCOULSON: We don\\'t know.\\n\\nNATASHA: But he\\'s alive.\\n\\nCOULSON: We think so. I\\'ll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.\\n\\nNATASHA: Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me. \\n\\nCOULSON: No, I\\'ve got Stark. You get the big guy.\\n\\nNATASHA: [pausing and hanging up the phone.] Bozhe moi. [Russian translation for My God]\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\n[At night, a slum in India it attacked by a sickness. A little girl runs into the middle of a makeshift hospital in someone\\'s home, pushing through the crowd frantically. She runs up the steps inside to greet the only doctor, Bruce Banner. They begin speaking in Hindu.]\\n\\nATTENDING WOMAN: What are you doing here?! Get out! You shouldn\\'t be here. \\n\\nLITTLE GIRL: I have to see the doctor. It\\'s my father.\\n\\nBRUCE: Calm down. What\\'s wrong. \\n\\nLITTLE GIRL: My father... [she looks to the other sick people, laying down and moaning in pain.]\\n\\nBRUCE: Is he like them?\\n\\n[The little girl holds out money, crumpled and looking desperate.]\\n\\nLITTLE GIRL: [In English] Please. \\n\\n[Banner and the little girl run quickly to the edge of town. She leads him quickly through narrow passageways, and is proving too fast to keep up with. Banner spots a nice car, and looks around, worried. He runs into the girls house, when she leaves through a window, untraceable.]\\n\\nBRUCE: Should have gotten paid up front, Banner.\\n\\nNATASHA: [Entering the room behind him, making Banner turn around.] You know, for a man who\\'s supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. \\n\\nBRUCE: Avoiding stress isn\\'t the secret.\\n\\nNATASHA: Then, what is it?

Because that\\'s not gonna work out for everyone.\\n\\nNATASHA: No. No. Of course not. I\\'m here on behalf of SHIELD.\\n\\nBRUCE: SHIELD. How did they find me?\\n\\nNATASHA: We never lost you, doctor. We\\'ve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.\\n\\nBRUCE: Why?\\n\\nNATASHA: Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in.\\n\\nBRUCE: What if I said no?\\n\\nNATASHA: I\\'ll persuade you.\\n\\nBRUCE: And what if the... other guy says no?\\n\\nNATASHA: You\\'ve been more than a year without an incident. I don\\'t think you wanna break that streak.\\n\\nBRUCE: [ gently pushing a cradle ] I don\\'t always get what I want.\\n\\nNATASHA: Doctor, we\\'re facing a potential global catastrophe.\\n\\nBRUCE: Well, those I actively try to avoid.\\n\\nNATASHA: This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.\\n\\n[She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner takes a closer look.]\\n\\nBRUCE: What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?\\n\\nNATASHA: Well, he wants you to find it. It\\'s been taken. It emits a gamma signature that\\'s too weak for us to trace. There\\'s no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that\\'s where I\\'d be.\\n\\nBRUCE: So Fury isn\\'t after the monster?\\n\\nNATASHA: Not that he\\'s told me.\\n\\nBRUCE: And he tells you everything?\\n\\nNATASHA: Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.\\n\\nBRUCE: He needs me in a cage?\\n\\nNATASHA: No one\\'s gonna put you in a...\\n\\nBRUCE: STOP LYING TO ME! [Banner slams his fists onto the table]\\n\\n[Natasha grabs a gun hidden under the table, pointing it at him. Banner stays still, grinning]\\n\\nBRUCE: I\\'m sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you\\'d do. Why don\\'t we do this the easy way, where you don\\'t use that, and the other guy doesn\\'t make a mess? Okay? Natasha...\\n\\n[Natasha, still wary, doesn\\'t lower her gun. She lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece.]\\n\\nNATASHA: [on her earpiece] Stand down.

Did you feel an overabundance of control?\\n\\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 1:  You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?\\n\\nFURY: Not Asgard, Loki.\\n\\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 2:  He can\\'t be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.\\n\\nFURY:  Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he\\'s worlds away, we can\\'t depend on him to help. It\\'s up to us.\\n\\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 1:  Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly...\\n\\nFURY:  PHASE 2 isn\\'t ready, our enemy is. We need a response team.\\n\\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 1:  The Avengers Initiative was shut down.\\n\\nFURY:  This isn\\'t about The Avengers.\\n\\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 1:  We\\'re running the world\\'s greatest covert security network and you\\'re gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.\\n\\nFURY:  I\\'m not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.\\n\\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 2: You believe?\\n\\nCOUNCIL MEMBER 1: War isn\\'t won by sentiment, Director.\\n\\nFURY:  No, it\\'s won by soldiers.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                             \\n\\n[A Brooklyn gym at night.

He sits down.]\\n\\nSTEVE: I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn\\'t say what we lost.\\n\\nFURY: We\\'ve made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.\\n\\nSTEVE: You here with a mission, sir?\\n\\nFURY: I am. \\n\\nSTEVE: Trying to get me back in the world?\\n\\nFURY:  Trying to save it. [Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files on HYDRA\\'S projects]\\n\\nSTEVE: Hydra\\'s secret weapon.\\n\\nFURY: Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That\\'s something the world sorely needs.\\n\\nSTEVE: Who took it from you?\\n\\nFURY: He\\'s called Loki. He\\'s not from around here. There\\'s a lot we\\'ll have to bring you up to speed on if you\\'re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.\\n\\nSTEVE: At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.\\n\\nFURY: Ten bucks says you\\'re wrong. There\\'s a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.\\n\\n[Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Fury starts walking out of the gym.] \\n\\nFURY: Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?\\n\\nSTEVE: [ Without missing a beat ] You should have left it in the ocean.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\n[Out in the Atlantic Ocean, Tony Stark, in his Iron Man suit, is cutting a pipeline transport with a laser cutter coming from his hand.

All this came from you.\\n\\nPEPPER: No. All this came from that. [Points to the energy in his chest plate.]\\n\\nTONY: Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit.\\n\\nPEPPER: Twelve percent?\\n\\nTONY: An argument can be made for fifteen.\\n\\nPEPPER: Twelve percent? For my baby?\\n\\nTONY: Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.\\n\\nPEPPER: Oooooh.\\n\\nTONY: My private elevator...\\n\\nPEPPER: You mean our elevator?\\n\\nTONY: Was steaming with sweaty workmen.

The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium. As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet. The police arrive and with no hesitation, he blasts the cars, flipping them over and over.]\\n\\nLOKI: Kneel before me. [The crowd ignores him. Three more Loki\\'s appear, surrounding and blocking the crowd from escaping.] I said KNEEL! [While the crowd quietly kneels, Loki embraces out his arms with a wide smile] Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It\\'s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life\\'s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.\\n\\nELDER GERMAN MAN: [As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an elder German man refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.] Not to men like you.\\n\\nLOKI: There are no men like me.\\n\\nELDER GERMAN MAN: There are always men like you.\\n\\nLOKI: Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example. [As Loki is about to execute the man with his scepter as the light glows blue. Right as the energy beam shoots out, Captain America arrives, diving in just in time to block the blast with his shield, and knocking down Loki]\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA: You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.\\n\\nLOKI: [Standing up] The soldier. A man out of time.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA: I\\'m not the one who\\'s out of time.\\n\\n[From above Captain America, the Quinjet arrives. A machine gun is pointed towards Loki, while Natasha speaks from inside the aircraft]\\n\\nNATASHA: Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.\\n\\n[Like greased lightning, Loki sends a blast of blue at the Quinjet. Natasha maneuvers it just in time, giving Cap the time to throw his shield at Loki. They both began to duke it out. Loki flings Cap to the ground, and then Cap throws his shield, but Loki swats it away. As Cap is knocked down by Loki, the scepter is pointed to Cap\\'s helmet]\\n\\nLOKI: Kneel.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA: Not today! [Cap flips and knocks him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and flips him over]\\n\\nNATASHA: This guy\\'s all over the place.\\n\\n[Suddenly AC/DC\\'s \"Shoot to Thrill\" overdrives to the Quinjets speakers]\\n\\nIRON MAN: Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? [Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his Iron Man suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. Iron Man touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has.] Make your move, Reindeer Games.\\n\\n[Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armour materializes away]\\n\\nIRON MAN: Good move.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA: Mr. Stark.\\n\\nIRON MAN: Captain.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\nINT.

Just get him here. We\\'re low on time. With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch from a distance, whispering.\\n\\nSTEVE I don\\'t like it.\\n\\nTONY What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?\\n\\nSTEVE I don\\'t remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.\\n\\nTONY Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What\\'s your thing? Pilates?\\n\\nSTEVE What?\\n\\nTONY It\\'s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle. Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.\\n\\nSTEVE Fury didn\\'t tell me he was calling you in.\\n\\nTONY Yeah, there\\'s a lot of things Fury doesn\\'t tell you. THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake violently.\\n\\nNATASHA Where\\'s this coming from? Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.\\n\\nSTEVE What\\'s the matter? Scared of a little lightning?\\n\\nLOKI I\\'m not overly fond of what follows. What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet. Not a light. A King. THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony puts the IRON MAN helmet on.\\n\\nIRON MAN Now there\\'s that guy.\\n\\nNATASHA Another Asgardian?\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA Think the guy\\'s a friendly?\\n\\nIRON MAN Doesn\\'t matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract\\'s lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA Stark, we need a plan of attack!\\n\\nIRON MAN I have a plan. Attack. IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a parachute to follow.\\n\\nNATASHA I\\'d sit this one out, Cap.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA I don\\'t see how I can.\\n\\nNATASHA These guys come from legends, they\\'re basically gods.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA There\\'s only one God, ma\\'am.

MOUNTAIN LEDGE \\xad NIGHT\\n\\nSomewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR. He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is angry to see him alive in this fashion.\\n\\nTHOR Where is the Tesseract?\\n\\nLOKI (LAUGHS) I missed you too.\\n\\nTHOR Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!\\n\\nLOKI Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth. Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up Loki. His brother. Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god.\\n\\nTHOR I thought you dead.\\n\\nLOKI Did you mourn?\\n\\nTHOR We all did. Our father...\\n\\nLOKI Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.\\n\\nTHOR We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?\\n\\nLOKI (TURNS AROUND) I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!\\n\\nTHOR So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki.\\n\\nLOKI (LAUGHS) And you\\'re doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I mean to rule them. And why should I not?\\n\\nTHOR You think yourself above them.\\n\\nLOKI Well, yes.\\n\\nTHOR Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill. Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around.\\n\\nLOKI I\\'ve seen worlds you\\'ve never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...\\n\\nTHOR Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?\\n\\nLOKI I am a king!\\n\\nTHOR Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.\\n\\nLOKI I don\\'t have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I\\'ve sent it off I know not where. Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.\\n\\nTHOR You listen well, brother. I...\\n\\nTHOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN\\n\\nMID-FLIGHT.\\n\\nLOKI I\\'m listening.\\n\\nEXT. FOREST \\xad CONTINUOUS\\n\\nTHOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up. IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet opens up.\\n\\nTHOR Do not touch me again!\\n\\nTONY Then don\\'t take my stuff.\\n\\nTHOR You have no idea what you\\'re dealing with.\\n\\nTONY Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?\\n\\nTHOR This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!\\n\\nTONY He gives up the Cube, he\\'s all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist. The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree.\\n\\nINSIDE THE SUIT\\n\\nTONY Okay. From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the hammer, summoning a ray of energy. IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch! Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.\\n\\nINSIDE THE SUIT\\n\\nJARVIS Power at 400% capacity.\\n\\nTONY How about that? IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.\\n\\nEXT. SKY \\xad NIGHT\\n\\nThe two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING him into the side of a mountain. THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.\\n\\nEXT. FOREST \\xad CONTINUOUS\\n\\nTHOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor\\'s face. Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor, with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with his fuckin\\' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest. IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up, ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift him and SMASH him down hard. Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he\\'s about to put the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him, but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce... CAPTAIN AMERICA\\'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN, stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA Hey! That\\'s enough! (comes down; looks at Thor) Now, I don\\'t know what you plan on doing here.\\n\\nTHOR I\\'ve come here to put an end to Loki\\'s schemes!\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA Then prove it! Put the hammer down.\\n\\nIRON MAN Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!\\n\\nTHOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÖLNIR. Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY, raises the hammer.\\n\\nTHOR\\n\\n(TO CAP) You want me to put the hammer down?\\n\\nTHOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER. CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE\\n\\nSHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE. IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.\\' Lying right next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks at both men.\\n\\nCAPTAIN AMERICA Are we done here?\\n\\nTHOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\nINT.

Loki eyes him as he walks, nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.\\n\\nINT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION \\xad NIGHT\\n\\nLoki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control panel of the cell.\\n\\nNICK FURY In case it\\'s unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass. Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki\\'s cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass. Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit his pants. Not a god, though.\\n\\nNICK FURY Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?! Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.\\n\\nNICK FURY Ant. Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel trap.\\n\\nNICK FURY Boot.\\n\\nLOKI\\n\\n(SMIRKING) It\\'s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me.\\n\\nNICK FURY Built for something a lot stronger than you.\\n\\nLOKI Oh, I\\'ve heard. Loki looks into the camera.\\n\\nINT. BRIEFING ROOM \\xad CONTINUOUS\\n\\nThe others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated. Banner looks at the monitor, intently.\\n\\nINT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION \\xad CONTINUOUS\\n\\n\\nLOKI The mindless beast, makes play he\\'s still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?\\n\\nNICK FURY How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can\\'t hope to control.\\n\\n(MORE)\\n\\nNICK FURY (CONT\\'D) You talk about peace and you kill `cause it\\'s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.\\n\\nLOKI Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is.\\n\\nNICK FURY\\n\\n(SMILING) Well, you let me know if Real Power wants a magazine or something. Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back at the camera, smirking.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\nINT. BRIEFING ROOM \\xad CONTINUOUS\\n\\nSteve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn\\'t even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --\\n\\nBANNER He really grows on you, doesn\\'t he?\\n\\nSTEVE Loki\\'s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what\\'s his play?\\n\\nTHOR\\n\\n(COMING TOO) He has an army called the Chitauri. They\\'re not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.\\n\\nSTEVE\\n\\n(SERIOUSLY) An army? From outer space?\\n\\nBANNER So he\\'s building another portal. That\\'s what he needs Erik Selvig for.\\n\\nTHOR Selvig?\\n\\nBANNER He\\'s an astrophysicist.\\n\\nTHOR He\\'s a friend.\\n\\nNATASHA Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours.\\n\\nSTEVE I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He\\'s not leading an army from here.\\n\\nBANNER I don\\'t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy\\'s brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.\\n\\nTHOR Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he\\'s my brother.\\n\\nNATASHA He killed eighty people in two days.\\n\\nTHOR He\\'s adopted.\\n\\nBANNER Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?\\n\\nTONY It\\'s a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to\\n\\nCOULSON) I\\'ll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won\\'t collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.\\n\\nTONY (CONT\\'D)\\n\\n(TO THOR) No hard feelings, Point Break. You\\'ve got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants.\\n\\n(TO CREW) Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn\\'t notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks\\n\\nAROUND) How does Fury do this?\\n\\nAGENT MARIA HILL He turns. Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING IMPLANT under Fury\\'s desk, without anyone noticing.\\n\\nTONY Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.\\n\\nAGENT MARIA HILL When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\\n\\nTONY Last night. The packet, Selvig\\'s notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?\\n\\nSTEVE Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?\\n\\nBANNER He\\'s got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.\\n\\nTONY Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.\\n\\nBANNER Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.\\n\\nTONY Finally, someone who speaks English.\\n\\nSTEVE Is that what just happened? Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows.\\n\\nTONY It\\'s good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You\\'re work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I\\'m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.\\n\\nBANNER (LOOKS DOWN) Thanks.\\n\\nNICK FURY (WALKING IN) Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him.\\n\\nSTEVE Let\\'s start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.\\n\\nNICK FURY I don\\'t know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I\\'d like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.\\n\\nTHOR Monkeys? I do not understand.\\n\\nSTEVE I do! I understood that reference. Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.\\n\\nTONY Shall we play, doctor?\\n\\nBANNER Let\\'s play some. As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\nINT. BANNER\\'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)\\n\\nBanner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation. Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many algorithms and equations.\\n\\nBANNER The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig\\'s reports on the Tesseract. But it\\'s gonna take weeks to process.\\n\\nTONY If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.\\n\\nBANNER All I packed was a tooth brush.\\n\\nTONY (SMILES) You know, you should come by STARK TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You\\'d love it, it\\'s candy land.\\n\\nBANNER Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.\\n\\nTONY Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises. Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD. Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.\\n\\nBANNER OW! Tony looks at Banner closely.\\n\\nSTEVE Hey!\\n\\nTONY Nothing?\\n\\nSTEVE\\n\\nAre you nuts?\\n\\nTONY You really have got a lid on it, haven\\'t you? What\\'s your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?\\n\\nSTEVE Is everything a joke to you?\\n\\nTONY Funny things are.\\n\\nSTEVE Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn\\'t funny. No offense, doctor.\\n\\nBANNER No, it\\'s alright. I wouldn\\'t have come aboard if I couldn\\'t handle pointy things.\\n\\nTONY You\\'re tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.\\n\\nSTEVE And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.\\n\\nTONY You think I\\'m not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn\\'t he telling us? I can\\'t do the equation unless I have all the variables.\\n\\nSTEVE You think Fury\\'s hiding something?\\n\\nTONY He\\'s a spy. Captain, he\\'s the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It\\'s bugging him too, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nBANNER (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...\\n\\nSTEVE Doctor? A beat.\\n\\nBANNER \\'A warm light for all mankind, Loki\\'s jab at Fury about the cube.\\n\\nSTEVE I heard it.\\n\\nBANNER (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn\\'t post that all over the news.\\n\\nSTEVE The Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York?\\n\\nBANNER It\\'s powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?\\n\\nTONY That\\'s just the prototype. I\\'m kind of the only name in clean energy right now.\\n\\nBANNER (referring to Tony) So, why didn\\'t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?\\n\\nTONY I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD\\'s secure files.\\n\\nSTEVE (taken by that) I\\'m sorry, did you say...?\\n\\nTONY Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we\\'ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry?\\n\\nSTEVE Yet you\\'re confused about why they didn\\'t want you around?\\n\\nTONY An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.\\n\\nSTEVE I think Loki\\'s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don\\'t stay focused, he\\'ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.\\n\\nTONY Following is not really my style.\\n\\nSTEVE\\n\\n(SMILING) And you\\'re all about style, aren\\'t you?\\n\\nTONY (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?\\n\\nBANNER Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.\\n\\nSTEVE Just find the cube. Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.\\n\\nBACK IN THE LAB\\n\\nTONY That\\'s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn\\'t have kept him on ice.\\n\\nBANNER The guy\\'s not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us.\\n\\nTONY What he\\'s got is an ACME dynamite kit.\\n\\nTONY (CONT\\'D) It\\'s gonna blow up in his face, and I\\'m gonna be there when it does.\\n\\nBANNER And I\\'ll read all about it.\\n\\nTONY Uh-huh. Or you\\'ll be suiting up like the rest of us.\\n\\nBANNER Ah, see. I don\\'t get a suit of armor. I\\'m exposed, like a nerve. It\\'s a nightmare.\\n\\nTONY You know, I\\'ve got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It\\'s part of me now, not just armor. It\\'s a... terrible privilege.\\n\\nBANNER But you can control it.\\n\\nTONY Because I learned how.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                           \\n\\n                         BANNER\\n          It\\'s different.\\n         Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the\\n         data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.\\n                         TONY\\n          Hey, I\\'ve read all about your accident.\\n          That much gamma exposure should have\\n          killed you.\\n                         BANNER\\n          So you\\'re saying that the Hulk... the\\n          other guy... saved my life?\\n                         (MORE)\\n                         BANNER (CONT\\'D)\\n          That\\'s nice.
